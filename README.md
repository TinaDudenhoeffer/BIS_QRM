The github repository consists of two folders (branches)

One branch 'exercises' consists of the exercises made during the lectures.
Each file consists of small exercises to
practice the commands that are taught in the lecture.
The other branch contains the assignments.

For the assignments, I would like to ask you (at 
least one of your team members) to:

1. Download the file into your Rstudio environment.
2. Make the exercises in R. Fill in your answers between 
the lines.
3. Copy the file with answers in your github account (edit).
4. Share them with me (fork).

You can find the literature (or links to the papers) under 'issues'.
